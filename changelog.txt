1. banner slideshow
	*changes were made to the following:
		- banner-image class for div renamed to banner-slideshow

			over the banner slideshow
			*buttons and elements are still on top and are clickable
			only the image is in the bottom layer

1. transferred contact-info to contact page category

*current issues with about page
- text is not formatted well, format changes when scaling changes
- paimon exits the parent div, will need to compare 
to traveller image in homepage to make it behave
similarly 
- gaps in between table rows, too big but won't adjust either

!!! search how to adjust gap between table rows
!!! check the properties of the classes about-header and about-text

*not able to work properly - have decided to just add comments to the code instead
